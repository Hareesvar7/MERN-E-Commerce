import os

def list_directories(request):
    # List the directories in the current working directory
    directories = [d for d in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isdir(d)]
    return '\n'.join(directories)




. Write the Cloud Function Code
Create a file named main.py with the following content:

python
Copy code
import os

def list_directories(request):
    # List the directories in the current working directory
    directories = [d for d in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isdir(d)]
    return '\n'.join(directories)
Create a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies:

plaintext
Copy code
# No external dependencies needed
2. Deploy the Cloud Function
Use the Google Cloud SDK to deploy the function. Run the following commands in your terminal or Cloud Shell:

bash
Copy code
# Set your Google Cloud project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Deploy the Cloud Function
gcloud functions deploy list_directories \
    --runtime python39 \
    --trigger-http \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --entry-point list_directories
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

3. Trigger the Function from Cloud Shell
After deployment, you will receive a URL for the Cloud Function. You can use curl to trigger it from Cloud Shell:

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET https://REGION-PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/list_directories
Replace REGION and PROJECT_ID with the appropriate values from the URL provided after deployment.

Important Notes:
Permissions: Ensure that the Cloud Function has the necessary permissions to access and list directories if you're running this in a more complex setup.
Cloud Shell: The Cloud Function's environment is different from Cloud Shell's environment. The function operates in its own isolated environment, which might not have the same directories or files as Cloud Shell.
This setup provides a simple HTTP-triggered function that lists directories. Adjustments might be needed based on specific requirements or environment constraints.
