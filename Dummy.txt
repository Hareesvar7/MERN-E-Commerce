I need an python script to delete the resourses in gcp


Show drafts

I'd be glad to assist you with creating a Python script to delete resources in GCP. However, to ensure the script's accuracy and effectiveness, I'll need some additional information:

1. Resource Types:

Please specify the exact types of resources you want to delete (e.g., Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud SQL instances).
2. Specific Resource IDs:

If you have specific resource IDs (e.g., instance names, bucket names), please provide them. Otherwise, we'll need to implement a filtering mechanism.
3. Deletion Criteria:

Define the criteria for resource deletion (e.g., resources older than a certain age, resources with specific labels).
4. Error Handling:

Specify how you want to handle potential errors during the deletion process (e.g., retrying failed operations, logging error messages).
5. Authentication:

Describe your authentication method (e.g., service account, OAuth).
Once I have this information, I can provide a tailored Python script using the google-cloud-resource-manager library. Here's a basic outline of the script structure:

Python
import os
from google.cloud import resource_manager

# Set up authentication (replace with your authentication method)
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/your/service_account.json"

# Create a Resource Manager client
client = resource_manager.ResourceManagerClient()

# Define the deletion criteria (replace with your criteria)
filter_expression = "name:my-resource"

# List resources matching the criteria
request = resource_manager.ListResourcesRequest(filter=filter_expression)
response = client.list_resources(request)

# Iterate over resources and delete them
for resource in response.resources:
    # Delete the resource (replace with the appropriate deletion method)
    client.delete_resource(resource.name)
Use code with caution.

Remember to replace the placeholder values and adjust the code based on your specific requirements.

Deleting GCP Resources by Tags Using Python
Understanding the Approach:

Resource Manager API: We'll utilize the Google Cloud Resource Manager API to list and delete resources.
Filter Expression: A filter expression based on tags will be used to identify the resources to be deleted.
Python Script:

Python
import os
from google.cloud import resource_manager

# Set up authentication (replace with your service account credentials)
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "/path/to/your/service_account.json"

# Create a Resource Manager client
client = resource_manager.ResourceManagerClient()

# Define the filter expression based on tags (adjust as needed)
filter_expression = "labels.environment:prod"  # Replace with your desired tag

# List resources matching the filter
request = resource_manager.ListResourcesRequest(filter=filter_expression)
response = client.list_resources(request)

# Iterate over resources and delete them
for resource in response.resources:
    # Get the resource type-specific client
    resource_type = resource.type
    if resource_type.startswith("compute.googleapis.com"):
        compute_client = resource_manager.ComputeEngineClient()
        # Handle Compute Engine resources (e.g., instances, disks)
        # ...
    elif resource_type.startswith("storage.googleapis.com"):
        storage_client = resource_manager.StorageClient()
        # Handle Storage resources (e.g., buckets)
        # ...
    else:
        # Handle other resource types (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions)
        # ...

    # Delete the resource using the appropriate client method
    print(f"Deleting resource: {resource.name}")
    # Example for deleting a Compute Engine instance:
    # compute_client.delete_instance(resource.name, project_id)





Authentication: Replace the placeholder with your service account credentials.
Filter Expression: Adjust the filter_expression to match your desired tag or combination of tags.
Resource Listing: The list_resources method retrieves resources based on the filter.
Resource-Specific Deletion: The code snippet provides a basic structure for handling different resource types. You'll need to replace the placeholder comments with the actual deletion methods for each resource type.
Deletion: Use the appropriate client method to delete the identified resources.
